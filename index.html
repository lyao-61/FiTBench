<h2>Object and Relationship Statistic</h2>
<p>For FISC-AG dataset, we provide annotations for 234, 253 frames with a total of 476, 229 bounding boxes of 35 object classes (excluding 'person'), and 1, 715, 568 instances of 25 relationship classes. For FISC-PVSG dataset, we provide annotations for 149, 484 frames with a total of 216, 855 bounding boxes of 128 object classes, and 117, 964 instances of 72 relationship classes. The following two figures visualizes the distribution of object and relationship categories in FISC-AG and FISC-PVSG, respectively. As shown in these two figure, compared with the FISC-AG dataset, the FISC-VidOR dataset has more object and relationship categories, increasing the data diversity. Some objects (e.g., 'floor' and 'food') and relations (e.g., 'holding' and 'in front of') occur frequently, while others (e.g., 'cookie' and 'squeezing') occur only a few times. However, even with such a distribution, for FISC-AG dataset, almost all objects have at least 10K instances and every relationship as at least 1K instances. For FISC-PVSG dataset, almost all objects have at least 1.5K instances and every relationship as at least 1.5K instances.
